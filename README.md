# Spy Search

**Spy Search** is an agentic search framework designed to outperform current web search agents with a focus on faster, more efficient daily usage.

While commercial solutions like Manus charge $200 per month, Spy Search leverages open-source models to provide a cost-effective alternative without sacrificing performance.
