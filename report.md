This introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of their features, differences from LLMs, and real-world impact in subsequent sections of this report.
AI agents and traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT represent distinct approaches to artificial intelligence, each with unique capabilities and limitations. While LLMs excel at generating human-like text based on vast datasets, AI agents go beyond mere text generation to perform autonomous actions, access external knowledge, and utilize tools—capabilities that set them apart in the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence [wYht]. 

One of the primary differences lies in autonomy. Traditional LLMs operate within a closed system, responding to prompts without the ability to take independent actions or interact with external tools. For example, ChatGPT can answer questions or generate content but cannot execute tasks like booking a flight or analyzing real-time data without human intervention. In contrast, AI agents are designed to autonomously perform such tasks by integrating with APIs, databases, and other software tools, enabling them to act on behalf of users [wYht]. 

Another key distinction is the scope of functionality. LLMs are primarily focused on language understanding and generation, making them ideal for conversational applications. However, their lack of access to real-time or external information limits their utility in dynamic environments. AI agents, on the other hand, can pull in up-to-date information from the web, interact with other systems, and adapt their behavior based on real-world data. This makes them far more versatile for applications requiring timely and context-aware decision-making [wYht]. 

Additionally, AI agents are capable of workflow automation, a feature absent in traditional LLMs. For instance, an AI agent can manage multi-step processes, such as compiling a report by gathering data from various sources, analyzing it, and presenting findings—all without human oversight. This ability to orchestrate complex tasks positions AI agents as transformative tools for industries ranging from healthcare to finance [wYht]. 

In summary, while LLMs serve as powerful tools for language-based tasks, AI agents represent a leap forward by combining language understanding with autonomous action, tool usage, and real-time data integration. These differences underscore the potential of AI agents to revolutionize how businesses and individuals leverage artificial intelligence for practical, real-world applications [wYht].
AI agents are distinguished by several key features that set them apart from traditional large language models (LLMs) and enable their advanced functionality. One of the most significant features is their ability to **use tools**, as highlighted by Alfie Marsh, CEO of Tool Flow AI [wYht]. Unlike LLMs, which are limited to generating text-based responses, AI agents can interact with external tools and systems, such as APIs, databases, and software applications, to perform tasks autonomously. This capability allows them to execute complex workflows, such as booking flights or managing calendars, without human intervention.

Another critical feature is their **access to external knowledge**. While LLMs rely on pre-trained data, AI agents can retrieve and incorporate real-time information from the internet or other external sources [wYht]. This dynamic knowledge access ensures that AI agents can provide up-to-date and contextually relevant responses, making them more versatile in real-world applications.

AI agents also exhibit **autonomous action**, meaning they can make decisions and take steps to achieve goals without continuous human input [wYht]. For example, an AI agent could autonomously troubleshoot a technical issue by accessing diagnostic tools, searching for solutions online, and implementing fixes. This autonomy is a stark contrast to LLMs, which require explicit prompts for every action.

The video from [NIco] further elaborates on the **hierarchical levels of agency** that AI agents can operate at. Level 1 involves basic tool use, where the agent leverages an LLM alongside external tools. Level 2 introduces **workflow automation**, where the agent orchestrates multiple steps to complete a task. Level 3, the most advanced, features **loop integration**, where the agent continuously refines its actions based on feedback, enabling iterative problem-solving and long-term goal achievement.

Together, these features—tool use, external knowledge access, autonomous action, and scalable agency levels—empower AI agents to perform a wide range of tasks with efficiency and adaptability, positioning them as transformative tools in the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.
AI agents operate at varying levels of agency, each offering distinct capabilities and applications. According to the video 'An Introduction to AI Agents (for 2025)' [NIco], these levels are categorized into three tiers, each building upon the previous one to provide increasingly sophisticated functionality.

At this foundational level, AI agents combine large language models (LLMs) with the ability to use external tools. This integration allows them to perform tasks beyond mere text generation, such as retrieving real-time data or interacting with software applications. For example, an AI agent at this level might use a calculator tool to solve mathematical problems or access a database to fetch updated information. This level represents the basic form of agency, where the AI can augment its responses with external resources but operates within a relatively narrow scope.

**Level 2: LLM Workflows**  
The second level introduces workflows, enabling AI agents to execute multi-step processes autonomously. Here, the agent can chain together a series of actions or tools to accomplish more complex tasks. For instance, an AI agent might analyze a dataset, generate a report, and then email it to a designated recipient—all without human intervention. This level of agency is particularly useful for repetitive or structured tasks, as it leverages the LLM's reasoning abilities to orchestrate workflows efficiently.

**Level 3: LLM in a Loop**  
The most advanced level involves integrating the LLM into a continuous feedback loop, where the AI agent can iteratively refine its actions based on outcomes or external inputs. This level enables dynamic adaptation and learning, making the agent suitable for unpredictable or evolving scenarios. For example, an AI agent managing a customer service system might adjust its responses based on real-time feedback from users, improving its performance over time. This level represents the pinnacle of AI agency, blending autonomy with adaptability.

These levels illustrate the progressive sophistication of AI agents, from basic tool-assisted tasks to fully autonomous, adaptive systems. Understanding these tiers is crucial for deploying AI agents effectively across different use cases, as each level offers unique advantages depending on the complexity and requirements of the task at hand.
AI agents are already demonstrating their transformative potential across various industries through real-world applications.

Traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have several limitations that hinder their ability to perform complex, real-world tasks autonomously. One major constraint is their lack of tool use; LLMs are confined to generating text-based responses and cannot interact with external systems or applications. For example, while an LLM can provide instructions on how to book a flight, it cannot execute the booking itself. Additionally, LLMs rely solely on their pre-trained knowledge, which can become outdated or lack context-specific information, limiting their accuracy and relevance in dynamic environments. Another critical limitation is their inability to take autonomous action—LLMs require human prompts for every step, making them inefficient for workflows that demand continuous or multi-step execution. AI agents address these shortcomings by integrating tool use, enabling them to interact with software, APIs, and databases to perform tasks like data retrieval or transaction processing. They also access real-time external knowledge, ensuring up-to-date and context-aware responses. Most importantly, AI agents operate autonomously, capable of initiating and completing multi-step processes without constant human intervention. For instance, an AI agent could autonomously research, compare, and book the best flight options based on user preferences, demonstrating how it overcomes the static and passive nature of traditional LLMs. These advancements make AI agents far more versatile and practical for real-world applications, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and actionable outcomes.
